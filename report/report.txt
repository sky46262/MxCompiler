	2.1 Lex and Parse
	I use Antlr to lex and parse the code, and generate a parsetree.
	2.2 Build AST
	I extend the Visitor of Antlr to walk the parse tree and build the AST.(Abstract Syntax Tree)
	2.3 Semantic Analyze
	I walk the AST twice to build a SymbolTable. The first time I build global symboltable, and the next time I check all the statements.
	SymbolTable is a stack of ScopedSymbolTable. ScopedSymbolTable is a hashtable with a name.
